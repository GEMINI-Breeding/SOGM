# SOGM
The Soil Optical Generative Model (SOGM) is a soil spectra simulation model that utilizes the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM).

It incorporates two two sub-models: spectra padding model and wet spectra simulation model.

Additionally, the SOGM is packaged with the PROSAIL model, which combines the PROSPECT-5, D, and 4SAIL models.
