# SOGM
Soil optical generative model (SOGM) is a soil spectra simulation model based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).

It also contains two sub-models: spectra padding model and wet spectra simulation model.

The PROSAIL model (containing PROSPECT-5,D and 4SAIL models) is also packaged with the SOGM.
